## Data Types
- Numerical
- Categorical
- Ordinal

```
Numerical data are numbers, and can be split into two numerical categories:
Discrete Data
- counted data that are limited to integers. Example: The number of cars passing by.
Continuous Data
- measured data that can be any number. Example: The price of an item, or the size of an item
Categorical data are values that cannot be measured up against each other. Example: a color value, or any yes/no values.
Ordinal data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on.
```

## Mean, Median, Mode
Mean - The average value
Median - The mid point value
Mode - The most common value
```
Mean.
The mean value is the average value.

Median.
The median value is the value in the middle, after you have sorted all the values.

Mode.
The Mode value is the value that appears the most number of times.
```

## Standard Deviation
Standard deviation is a number that describes how spread out the values are.
- A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value.
- A high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range.

As we have learned, the formula to find the standard deviation is the square root of the variance

## Variance
Variance is another number that indicates how spread out the values are.
To calculate the variance you have to do as follows:
1. Find the mean
2. For each value: find the difference from the mean
3. For each difference: find the square value
4. The variance is the average number of these squared differences

## Percentiles
Percentiles are used in statistics to give you a number that describes the value that a given percent of the values are lower than.

## Data Distribution
Generation of synthetic data for testing
- Histogram

## Normal Data Distribution
In probability theory this kind of data distribution is known as the normal data distribution, or the Gaussian data distribution, after the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss who came up with the formula of this data distribution.

## Scatter Plot
A scatter plot is a diagram where each value in the data set is represented by a dot
